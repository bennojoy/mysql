MySQL Server
============

This roles helps to install MySQL Server across RHEL and Ubuntu variants.
Apart from installing the MySQL Server, it applies basic hardening, like
securing the root account with password, and removing test databases. The role
can also be used to add databases to the MySQL server and create users in the
database. It also supports configuring the databases for replication--both
master and slave can be configured via this role.

Requirements
------------

This role requires Ansible 1.4 or higher, and platform requirements are listed
in the metadata file.

Role Variables
--------------

The variables that can be passed to this role and a brief description about
them are as follows:

      # The port for mysql server to listen
      mysql_port: 3306

      # The bind address for mysql server, defaults to "127.0.0.1"
      # Set it to your public "0.0.0.0" to allow external connections
      # (i.e. for replication)
      mysql_bind_address: "127.0.0.1"

      # The root DB password
      # by default the value is null and your root DB password is left untouched
      mysql_root_db_pass: foobar

      # A list that has all the databases to be
      # created and their replication status:
      mysql_db:                                 
           - name: foo
             replicate: yes
           - name: bar
             replicate: no

      # A list of the mysql users to be created
      # and their password and privileges:
      mysql_users:                              
           - name: benz
             pass: foobar
             priv: "*.*:ALL"

      # If the database is replicated the users
      # to be used for replication:
      mysql_repl_user:                          
        - name: repl
          pass: foobar

      # The role of this server in replication:
      mysql_repl_role: master

      # A unique id for the mysql server (used in replication):
      mysql_db_id: 7

Examples
--------

1) Install MySQL Server and set the root password, but don't create any
database or users.

      - hosts: all
        roles:
        - role: mysql
          mysql_root_db_pass: foobar

2) Install MySQL Server and create 2 databases and 2 users.

      - hosts: all
        roles:
          - role: mysql
            mysql_root_db_pass: foobar
            mysql_db: [{name: benz}, {name: benz2}]
            mysql_users:
              - {name: ben3, pass: foobar, priv: "*.*:ALL"}
              - {name: ben2, pass: foo}

Note: If users are specified and password/privileges are not specified, then
default values are set.

3) Install MySQL Server and create 2 databases and 2 users and configure the
database as replication master with one database configured for replication.

      - hosts: all
        roles:
         - role: mysql
           mysql_root_db_pass: foobar
           mysql_db:
             - {name: benz, replicate: yes }
             - {name: benz2, replicate: no}
           mysql_users:
             - {name: ben3, pass: foobar, priv: "*.*:ALL"}
             - {name: ben2, pass: foo}
           mysql_repl_user: [{name: repl, pass: foobar}]

4) A fully installed/configured MySQL Server with master and slave
replication.

      - hosts: master
        roles:
         - role: mysql
           mysql_db: [{name: benz}, {name: benz2}]
           mysql_users:
             - {name: ben3, pass: foobar, priv: "*.*:ALL"},
             - {name: ben2, pass: foo}
           mysql_db_id: 8

      - hosts: slave
        roles:
         - role: mysql
           mysql_db: none
           mysql_users: none
           mysql_repl_role: slave
           mysql_repl_master: vm2
           mysql_db_id: 9
           mysql_repl_user: [{name: repl, pass: foobar}] }

Note: When configuring the full replication please make sure the master is
configured via this role and the master is available in inventory and facts
have been gathered for master. The replication tasks assume the database is
new and has no data.
